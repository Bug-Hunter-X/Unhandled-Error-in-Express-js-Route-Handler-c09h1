# Unhandled Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  missing error handling.  Specifically, the `/users/:id` route fails to handle cases where `req.params.id` is invalid or the database query fails to find a user with that ID.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js app with a vulnerable route.  The route fetches user data based on the ID provided in the URL.  However, it lacks error handling for various scenarios, such as:

* Invalid user ID (e.g., non-numeric, non-existent ID)
* Database query errors (e.g., connection failure, unexpected database response)

This lack of error handling can result in unhandled exceptions, causing the server to crash or return unhelpful error messages to the client.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a robust solution that incorporates comprehensive error handling. The improved route now gracefully manages invalid IDs and potential database errors, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages to the client.
